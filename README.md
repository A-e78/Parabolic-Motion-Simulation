# Parabolic-Motion-Simulation
This repository contains a Python program that simulates the parabolic motion of a projectile. The program calculates the trajectory of a projectile launched with a given initial velocity and angle, and animates its motion using the matplotlib library.

# Project Description

The program prompts the user for initial conditions, including the initial velocity (v0), launch angle (theta), initial x-position (x0), and initial y-position (y0). Using these inputs, it calculates the projectile's trajectory considering gravitational acceleration. The simulation includes:

Calculation of Trajectory: Computes the x and y positions of the projectile at each time step.

Animation of Motion: Uses matplotlib to create an animation that visualizes the projectile's parabolic path.

# Features
User Input: Collects initial velocity, launch angle, and initial positions from the user.

Trajectory Calculation: Uses kinematic equations to calculate the projectile's position over time.

Animation: Visualizes the motion of the projectile in a 2D plot.

Estimation of Range and Maximum Height: Calculates the maximum horizontal distance and peak height of the projectile.

# How to Use

Clone the repository.
Ensure you have matplotlib installed (pip install matplotlib).
Run the program (python filename.py) and input the required initial conditions when prompted.
The program will display an animation of the projectile's motion.

This project is a great demonstration of basic physics principles and the use of Python for scientific computing and visualization.
